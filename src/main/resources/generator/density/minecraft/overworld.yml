# NukkitX Standard Generator - Overworld density generator preset

# The scale factors are not just arbitrary constants. Vanilla uses the following scale factors:
#    low/high noise: 684.412
#    selector noise: 684.412/80
#    depth noise: 200
# First of all, since Notch seems to despise anything and everything that is standard, Minecraft's definition of "octave" is exactly
# the opposite of what it should be. Rather than having a lacunarity of 2 and a persistence of 0.5, it uses a lacunarity of 0.5 and
# a persistence of 2. This means that to convert Minecraft's scale values to the universally accepted ones, we use the formula
#    scale = vanillaScale / (2 ** (octaves - 1))
# Since vanilla uses 8 octaves for selector noise and 16 octaves for low/high and depth noise, we get the following scale factors:
#    low/high noise: 0.0208865966796875
#    selector noise: 0.066837109375
#    depth noise: 0.006103515625
# But wait! There's more! Minecraft only samples noise values every 4 blocks along the X and Z axes and every 8 blocks along the Y
# axis, and interpolates linearly between them. This is a significant optimization, as it reduces the number of required noise calculations
# down to only 1/(4*4*8)=1/128 of what it would be, and only causes minor artifacts (since the noise rarely changes too significantly
# over a distance of 4 blocks. (wow, an actual optimization in Minecraft? what's going on!?!) We do this as well, however for some
# reason Minecraft samples the noise values at the scaled-down coordinates rather than the real ones. Our final scale factors are:
#    low/high noise: 0.005221649169921875 (on X/Z axis), 0.0026108245849609375 (on Y axis)
#    selector noise: 0.01670927734375 (on X/Z axis), 0.008354638671875 (on Y axis)
#    depth noise: 0.00152587890625 (on X/Z axis) (depth noise is only sampled in 2D)
