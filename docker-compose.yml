# To execute the server using docker:
#
# The first time: (it creates a docker container named powernukkit, this command works only once)
# docker-compose run --name powernukkit server
#
# You may change the name if you want to run multiple instances. Keep the server at the end, it's not part of the name.
# If you change the name, replace powernukkit from the commands below with the name that you have choosen
#
# To return to the terminal and keep the server running:
# Keep holding CTRL, press P, release P, press Q, release Q, and release CTRL
# This is called escape sequence.
#
# After running the command above you can run the other commands from anywhere, you don't need to be inside your server folder.
#
# If you need help, send us a message at https://discuss.powernukkit.org or chat with at https://powernukkit.org/discord

# Starting interactively (CTRL+C will stop it, use the escape sequence to detach without stopping it)
# docker start powernukkit -i
#
# Starting seeing the log (CTRL+C will not stop it but you won't be able to run commands)
# docker start powernukkit -a
#
# Starting in the background
# docker start powernukkit
#
# Opening the server console which were running in background: (you won't see previous log messages, just start typing commands)
# docker attach powernukkit
#
# Stopping the server that is running in background:
# docker stop powernukkit
#
# To remove the container that you have created (the data folder will not be deleted, it must be stopped)
# docker rm powernukkit
#
# To update, remove the container, change the image version below and run the first time command again.
