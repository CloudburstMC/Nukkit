How to submit a bug report
---

Before creating an issue, make sure:
  1. Your title and content is not confusing or content-less.
  2. All text is written in proper English.
  
If it's a bug or problem:
  1. This bug can be reproduced.
  2. This bug can be found in the latest build.
  3. Dumps, backtraces or files are provided.
  4. It's you yourself who first found this bug.
  
If it's advice or a feature request:
  1. This feature does not exist in the latest build.
  2. This feature is logical and clear-cut.
  3. It's you yourself who first came up with the idea.
 
Nukkit will create a bug report for EVERY exception and error detected, and there are some columns you need to fill out in the report. If multiple exceptions are triggered, you should combine the stacktrace into one report and then submit the report.

In the report, you can see if the error is caused by Nukkit or a plugin. However, when "PLUGIN ERROR" is "false" and there are plugins running, it does not necessarily indicate that the error is caused by Nukkit.
 
To submit bugs and problems, please upload the automatically generated report. Make sure you have filled in all blanks in the template. Please provide **as much information as you could**, or our developers might got stuck or confused when looking into your issue. 

To submit feature requests and suggestions, please explicitly describe the feature you want or your suggestion.

**Note that the Issues section on GitHub is not for contents that are not related to the two categories listed above. Irrelevant issues will be closed. Please visit our forums for other kinds of discussions.**
