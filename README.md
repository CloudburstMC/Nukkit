Introduction
-------------

Nukkit is nuclear-powered server software for Minecraft: Pocket Edition.
It has a few key advantages over other server software:

* Written in Java, Nukkit is faster and more stable.
* Having a friendly structure, it's easy to contribute to Nukkit's development and rewrite plugins from other platforms into Nukkit plugins.

Nukkit is **under improvement** yet, we welcome contributions.
